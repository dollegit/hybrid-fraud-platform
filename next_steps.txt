### What to do next:

1.  **Apply the changes** to your `create_project_structure.sh` and `install_prerequisites.sh` files.

2.  **Completely stop and delete your current Minikube cluster** to start fresh:
    ```bash
    minikube stop
    minikube delete
    ```

3.  **Log out and log back in.** This is crucial to make sure your user is correctly recognized as part of the `docker` group.

4.  **Start Minikube again** using the updated command (without `sudo`):
    ```bash
    minikube start --cpus=6 --memory=16384 --disk-size=50g --driver=docker --kubernetes-version=v1.30.0
    minikube addons enable ingress
    ```

5.  **Re-run your setup script**:
    ```bash
    ./setup-environment.sh
    ```
